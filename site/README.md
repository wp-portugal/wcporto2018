# WordCamp Porto 2018 Stylesheet
To get started just do `npm install`. This will install all dependencies.

Then you can run `gulp` and it will keep the `watch` method alive. Otherwise you can run `gulp -styles` and it will compile once.

The compiled CSS is available at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-portugal/wcporto2018/master/site/dist/css/style.min.css`
